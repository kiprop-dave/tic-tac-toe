## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size ✅
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page ✅
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person ✅
- Bonus 1: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser ✅
- Bonus 2: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win ❌

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

I haven't been able to come up with an algorithm to make the game against the cpu competitive. I will add that feature soon. I also plan on making this a fullstack game that allow two people to play online.
